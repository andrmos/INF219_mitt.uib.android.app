# Mitt UiB Android app
This application was programmed as part of the course <i>INF219: Project in informatics 1</i> at University of Bergen, spring 2016.

At the time of the project, there didn’t exist any native Android application for the information system, <i>Mitt UiB</i>, used at University of Bergen, so the project was suitable for the <i>INF219</i> course.

Due to the fact that Mitt UiB uses the open REST API [<i>Canvas LMS</i>](https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/index.html), the project could be realized.
